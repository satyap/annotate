annotate
========


What
----

Put a text and EXIF caption on images, directly on the viewable image. Control the size, position, and orientation.

How
---

ruby annotate.rb -t "title/text of image" -i input\_file.jpg -o output\_file.jpg

Why
---

ImageMagick command line syntax is dense, impenetrable, and very powerful. I
wrote a shellscript at first, and then I wanted to do more comlpicated things
from command-line options, so I did a Ruby script.
